## The idea about the bot
Its come from my love to jamming with people and find the songs that work the best.<br>
The app is for my frinds and me and not for commercial purpose.

## What i used for building the app?
- node.JS - only backend for this app. <br>
- Genius API for lyrics. <br>
- whatsapp-web.js - a package for connect whatsapp to your project.<br>
- QRcode Terminal Edition - a package that help with display some data to the terminal.
 this is for scanning the QR code for connecting my whatsapp account and my server in my project.
